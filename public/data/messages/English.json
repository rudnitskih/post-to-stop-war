This way, Russians are trying to kill as many civilians in Ukraine as possible because it is civilians who most often step on landmines. Landmines not only hinder people's transportation but also cause severe problems for agriculture, which remains one of the main sectors of Ukraine's economy. The experts estimate it will take at least ten years to demine Ukraine. \n\nRussia is a terrorist state that must be stopped.

Europeans think that if they respected Russians more, then Russians would not have started a war against the Western world by attacking Ukraine. Here a logical question arises: why should Russia be respected? For 30 years of independence, Russians have not created decent living conditions for themselves, although they have considerable deposits of natural resources. Russians failed to convince the world that their values and way of life were worth emulating. Drunkenness, aggression, domestic violence, disregard for human rights, and intolerance: this is Russia’s legacy over the past 30 years. \n\nThe Russians came to kill Ukrainians only because they do not like Ukraine's European integration. Russians believe that they can prevent an independent country from developing as it sees fit. People who commit such actions do not deserve respect, only condemnation and punishment.\n\nVisual author: Sviatoslav Zembitskyy\n"

In early May, the Russian army deliberately fired a missile at the museum in the Kharkiv region dedicated to the outstanding thinker and philosopher Hryhoriy Skovoroda. Russian invaders are looting museums in the temporarily occupied territories. In particular, valuable collections were taken to Russia and occupied Crimea from the museums of Mariupol and Melitopol. More than 15,000 pieces were stolen from museum exhibits in the Kherson region alone. The looting of Ukrainian museums and cultural institutions is a large-scale Russian crime. Destroyed landmarks are lost forever, and stolen unique artifacts may never return. Just imagine the looted Louvre or the bombed Colosseum. \n\nIf Russians are not stopped in Ukraine, they will destroy and loot cultural heritage worldwide. \n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

    "English": "**The war makes people less tolerant.**\n\nIt is both physically and mentally exhausting. People experience grief, fear, fatigue, and intense anxiety. The influx of emotions prompts some people to seek a scapegoat to release negativity. As the war drags on, the stress level increases, and the ability to understand the opinions, decisions, and needs of others decreases. Ukrainian and Western societies might observe these processes right now. Those who remained in Ukraine and residents of other countries perceive the Ukrainians who went abroad as the lucky ones. \nThe general level of dissatisfaction and aggression increases. Russians reinforce the manifestations of such human emotions through their informational and psychological operations. War is a difficult time. But if most people keep supporting and not condemning others, Putin and Russia will never win. In addition, emotionally mature and resilient people will rebuild their lives faster after the war. \n\nAs the famous Ukrainian poet Lina Kostenko said, “There is so much grief in the world, so people, let’s be mutually beautiful!”\n\nVisual author: Sviatoslav Zembitskyy\n"

    "English": "**Despite the crumbled infrastructure, Ukrainians rejoice to be free from the Russian occupation.**\n\nOne of the vivid examples is the liberated Kherson, a regional capital in the south of Ukraine famous for its watermelons, the nearest administrative center to Crimea. Kherson has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The Russians demanded submission from the Khersonians. Those who refused to cooperate with occupiers were often tortured, killed, and had their relatives kidnapped. After the city's liberation, experts identify bodies found in dozens of mass graves, just like in Bucha and the Kharkiv region. When the Russians were retreating from the city, they destroyed many critical infrastructure facilities. Despite so much grief, the people of Kherson are still happy that they once again live at the Ukrainian territory. People are digging up Ukrainian flags buried in the ground during the occupation and tearing down Russian propaganda posters. The arrival of Ukrainian troops for them meant the end of fear and the prohibition of a free life. Residents of Kherson stand in queues for hours at Ukrainian supermarkets and volunteer hubs, yet, they rejoice at Ukrainian goods and aid. \n\nUkrainians are strong people, but without the support of the world, they will not be able to manage the consequences of the Russian invasion. Stay with Ukraine till its victory!\n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

He must give them something, provide them with comfort, and tell them what to do. Russia destroys Ukraine's energy infrastructure, counting on Ukrainians to demand that Ukraine's president immediately brings back all benefits of the civilization. The Russian logic presumes sitting down at the negotiating table and ceding territories to Russia. It will give Russia time to recover and start a new war. Building a new empire is the cherished dream of Russia's dictatorial regime. Instead, Ukrainians have always decided everything at the community level. So now, the Ukrainian community agrees that it would rather give up the comfort to preserve their country's independence. Ukraine's leadership must execute this will. Ukrainians do not expect the authorities to magically restore the country's full energy supply. Business owners and communities buy generators and Starlinks at their own expense. Ukrainians share life hacks on how to survive without electricity, water, and heat. They help those in difficult circumstances and do not expect reimbursement from the state budget. They know state funds should primarily go toward Ukraine's Armed Forces. \n\nUkrainians show the world that democracy and freedom are more important than a comfortable life.

More than 40% of Ukrainian refugees in Great Britain also have jobs. Ukrainians are not \"a burden to the budget of Western countries,\" as Russian propaganda claims.

    "English": "**Russia can use the Orthodox Church for subversive activity in Europe.**\n\nOver the past five years, the Russian Orthodox Church has been purchasing real estate in the West. In particular, it bought properties in Norway: some are located near the Haakonsvern military bases, and some – in Kirkenes, a few kilometers from the border with Russia. The purposes, besides the religious ones, for the Russian priests to use this real estate remain unknown. In Ukraine, for example, the Russian Orthodox churches stored Russian weapons and hid militants before the full-scale war. Many priests cooperated with the occupiers and assisted them. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, the Security Service of Ukraine has opened 23 criminal proceedings against the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. Charges range from classic intelligence gathering to helping Russians adjust their artillery strikes on Ukraine. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, openly supports the war against Ukraine.\n\nLet's keep in mind that the Russian church is the provider of Putin's regime. \n\nVisual author: Anastasiia Hlivinska\n"

Putin has repeatedly stated that the Ukrainian nation does not exist.

Hate speech has always been an essential tool in wars. The aggressor needs it to justify one’s aggressive actions and keep public support. Since the Second World War, the actions of propagandists have been classified as international crimes. Incitement to genocide or crimes against humanity received the highest degrees of punishment. Two Nazi propagandists were tried at the Nuremberg Trials, one of whom was executed. Neither killed anyone, but they played a significant role in the mass killing of civilians. The Russian media lie and incite the killing of civilians, and they are a threat not only to Ukrainians. \n\nAny nation can become a target of propaganda.

However, Russia has long lost the trust of the global community, given that Russia’s official statements are tales reinforced by domestic propaganda. It is not difficult to check that Russia is lying. Ukraine has invited an IAEA mission to check the condition of all facilities that, according to Russia, are involved in producing a radiological bomb.

    "English": "**The Russian war fundamentally changed the geopolitical mood of Ukrainians.**\n\nUkraine’s largest river, Dnipro, divides the country into the Eastern and the Western parts. Before the war, most residents of the Eastern part, which was once colonized by the Russian empire, were more tolerant toward Russia. The Western part, on the other hand, had more pro-European views as its territories once belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Polish Commonwealth. Ukrainian sociology reflected similar sentiments: according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, in 2020 and early 2021, 41% of respondents had a good attitude toward Russia, and 42% had a bad one. After the start of the full-scale Russian war, the situation changed: according to the sociological group “Rating”, 86% of respondents support Ukraine's accession to the EU, and 83% support accession to NATO. Ukrainians do not consider themselves a formal or informal part of Russia and want to preserve their country’s independence. This shows the manipulations behind public figures talking about the possibility of “peaceful” negotiations as Russia keeps occupying Eastern and Southern regions and attempts annexing these regions. The world wants the crisis caused by the Russian war to end as soon as possible. However, surrendering parts of Ukrainian territories to Russia will stimulate the aggressor to continue the war. For Russia, “peaceful” plans are a manifestation of weakness, which will eventually encourage Russians to start new conflicts. \nRussia must lose the same way the German Third Reich lost. This is the only thing that will stop the war and the crisis. Do not believe Russia's provocative statements and support Ukraine!\n\nVisual author: Sviatoslav Zembitskyy\n"

Ukrainian utility services work quickly and efficiently. They often do their work under Russian bombardment. Russian rockets regularly kill people who repair water pipes and electricity networks or clear the rubble of destroyed buildings. Utility workers belong to the heroes of the Ukrainian invisible front. Their work gives Ukrainians peace even in the direst situations. \n\nThe next winter in Ukraine will probably be the most difficult in the last thirty years. But Ukraine will persevere and win the war because all Ukrainians are making maximum efforts for this. Support Ukrainians to bring this victory moment closer. \n\nVisual author: Khrysryna Valko\n"

Russian soldiers went to people's homes together with representatives of election commissions and demanded people to vote. When the total number of votes in the \"referendum\" still turned out to be insufficient, the Russian Federation even counted the incomplete ballots as in favor of annexation. The Russians are trying to create an impression that their country protects the interests of the Ukrainian people. In fact, Russia – like many parasites – needs this imitation to survive. This is because Russia still hopes that it will be able to win the war against Ukraine and return to the community of civilized countries with time. That is why the occupiers create illegitimate documents and want both the West and Russians to believe in their authenticity. Remember that the Russian Federation violates the laws, destroys the security system of the world, threatens with nuclear strikes, and is preparing for further escalation of hostilities in Europe.\n\nDo not trust Russia, condemn its actions and demand your governments to completely isolate Russia from the world.\n"

Europe gives loans to Ukraine to support its economy during the war. Europe is facing a response from Russia, which is using gas as a weapon. Russia is trying to break the unity within the EU by manipulating energy prices. This comes on top of the highest inflation in the last 40 years, which comes as a result of printing money during the pandemic. Does it feel good to pay this price? No. But if Europe does not pay this price with money, this will pose a threat to the basic values and the usual way of life, to which generations of Europeans have already become accustomed. Ukrainians, too, did not want to believe in the war before the start of the full-scale invasion, and they were more worried about the fall in GDP. Now, however, they are forced to think how to survive. Before the start of the Russian war in Ukraine, the EU was too dependent on Russian energy sources. European politicians saw Russia as their firewood shed, from which you can get energy: oil and gas, and where you just need to send money. The economic model of many states became reliable on these cheap energy sources.  Billions of dollars went to Russia, fueling Putin's thirst for conquests and revenge. Unfortunately, many Europeans have forgotten the golden rule of diversification which means that you should not put all your eggs in one basket. Europeans made their market too dependent on one gas supplier: Russia. Of course, when the war began, Russia exploited this weakness because it knew about it. The EU believed that this weapon could not be used against Europe because it did not benefit Putin. Indeed, Putin is much more dependent on the European market than Europe is on Russian energy, but he still took this step. The Russian budget has already become deficit due to Putin's self-embargo, so Gazprom is reducing production and will never again become that rich company that buys football clubs and some European politicians. The EU needs time to correct the mistakes of the past because now, it needs to build infrastructure to get gas from other regions of the world. Until then, it is necessary to reduce consumption and pay more due to the shortage in the market. This is the price for freedom, which, fortunately, can be paid with money. Otherwise, we would have to pay for this freedom with the lives of Europeans. Ukraine is currently paying this price for everyone. \n\n_Serhiy Fursa, investment banker, deputy director at Dragon Capital_\n\nVisual author: Anastasiia Hlivinska\n"

    "English": "**In Ukraine, the Russians are repeating the scenarios of the Hitler regime of the 1930s and 1940s.**\n\nEven the beginning of the full-scale invasion is an allusion to the World War II: the Russians invaded Ukraine at about 4 a.m. without declaring war. Before the start of mass hostilities, the Russian Federation declared its protection of Russian-speakers in Eastern Ukraine and supported separatists in Donbas in 2014. In the same way, Hitler \"protected\" German speakers in the Sudetenland in 1938. The Russians annexed Crimea in March 2014, just as the Germans conducted the Anschluss of Austria in March 1938. Russians consider themselves a superior nation and are punishing their “little brothers” as they call Ukrainians for every manifestation of independence. This can be seen from the intensity of the bombings of Ukrainian cities, which take place on significant dates for Ukraine. For example, on June 28, on the Day of the Constitution of Ukraine, the Russians massively shelled the South and East of Ukraine, and the day before, they destroyed a shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk. On July 28, on Ukraine's Statehood Day, Russia massively shelled 7 regions of the country. Russians are a nation that wants to start a new world war according to Hitler's methods and take over Europe. \n\nUkraine needs weapons to stop the aggressor and end this war!\n\nVisual author: Nastya Gorban\n"

    "English": "**Russians are bombing power plants, water supply systems, and other infrastructure in Ukraine to force Ukrainians to surrender.**\n\nThe Russian Federation is losing battles in the east of Ukraine and is barely holding on to the captured southern regions. That is why more and more often Russian missiles cut cities off the grid, damage water supply systems, and hit objects near Zaporizhzhya and Pivdenno-Ukrayinsk nuclear power plants. Russia increases the pressure on Ukraine this way. The occupiers want the Ukrainian authorities to take a seat at the negotiation table and give up on recapturing the Russia-occupied territories. If successful, the Russian Federation will have time to restore its military power and economy and gain a formal reason to demand the lifting Western sanctions. Ukrainians are holding on and refusing to negotiate with the aggressor country. Russia must lose the war in Ukraine and answer for its crimes. Otherwise, the Russian war will spread to other European countries. \n\nDo not forget that Ukraine is fighting the Russian invasion of the EU’s border!\n"

    "English": "**Why not only Putin but every Russian is to blame for the war against Ukraine?**\n\n1\\. \"This is Putin's war, not the Russian war.\" Putin started this war and ordered the destruction of Ukrainian cities. But these are Russian citizens, who drop bombs on residential buildings, kill civilians during evacuations, torture Ukrainian prisoners and locals, loot and destroy property. Similarly, Putin did not perpetrate the genocide of Ukrainians in Bucha and Mariupol. Russian soldiers did, although Putin is undoubtedly guilty of it, too, as the head of a terrorist state.\n\n2\\. \"The war is just Putin's sick ambitions.\" Long before Putin was born, different Russian regimes and rulers spent centuries trying to seize Ukrainian territories, destroy the culture and the language, and deny the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation. A recent CNN survey shows that 64% of Russian responders consider Ukrainians and Russians as one nation.\n\n3\\. \"I did not kill anyone.\" Everyone who lives or works in Russia sponsors the war. The money from the Russian budget buys missiles and bombs flying at Ukrainian cities. To be complicit in the war, you don't need to kill anyone as long as you buy ammunition.\n\n4\\. \"We can't change anything.\" Change is never easy. Over the last 30 years, three revolutions have taken place in Ukraine. Ukrainians went out on mass protests, disagreeing with the policies of the governments of that time. Ukrainians paid a terrible price in 2014; back then, more than a hundred protesters were killed. On the contrary, Russians keep believing the propaganda unconditionally and are afraid or unwilling to change anything.\n\n5\\. \"Why are Russian athletes, scientists, or artists at fault?\" Abroad they all represent Russia, the aggressor state that invaded the territory of independent Ukraine and is killing people there.\n\nDemand that Russians bear responsibility for the war against Ukraine. Remind them that not only Putin is to blame, but every one of them. \n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

On May 16, during the evacuation of Ukrainian defenders from \"Azovstal\" in Mariupol, the Red Cross acted as a neutral mediator when the soldiers were exiting the city, which did not spare the Ukrainian prisoners of war. In late July, Russian artillery fired at a prison in a temporarily occupied Olenivka, where they kept Ukrainian prisoners of war. Approximately 40 people were killed, and another 130 were injured. The Red Cross representatives failed to access the prisoners of war. Neither were they able to reach the wounded Ukrainian soldiers and the bodies of those killed in Olenivka. In early August, the human rights organization Amnesty International noted in its report that the Ukrainian military endangered civilians by stationing in schools and hospitals. This statement is a cynical manipulation. At the same time, Amnesty International did not pay enough attention to the crimes committed by Russians in Ukraine. Such statements are part of Russia's discrediting campaign against Ukraine. \n\nRussian aggression in Ukraine has shown that the conventional approaches of international human rights organizations are ineffective.

Besides, Usyk reminded the world about Russia's war against Ukraine on live TV. At the press conference before the fight, the Ukrainian boxer wore Ukrainian national clothes and sang a popular Ukrainian song, \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" Immediately after the match, Usyk ended his speech with the words, \"Ukraine will win!\" \n\nUkraine will win, but it will happen faster with support from the rest of the world.

    "English": "**The EU must resist Russian interference in the public dialogue of the EU member states.** \n\nRussia manipulates democratic processes in Europe using propaganda and pro-Russian activists. The recent protest of thousands of people in the capital of the Czech Republic, Prague, clearly shows that. The protesters demanded the government's re-election and restored cooperation with the Russian Federation, especially concerning purchasing Russian gas and oil. The aggressor country is amping up its pressure on the European community in all possible ways so that the West relieves the sanctions introduced due to the Russian war in Ukraine. It is crucial to understand that Europe will be able to reject Russian energy within a year. Consequently, Russia will lose one of its last leverages against Western countries. So Russia is using all its resources to force the EU to negotiate. \n\nHowever, negotiations with the aggressor are possible only after the Russian withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and admission of guilt in starting the war. Other scenarios will only increase Russia's appetite for further invasion of European countries. \n\nVisual author: Iryna Zarubina\n"

    "English": "**Any response from the Ukrainian military to the invading country is justified.** \n\nAfter the plan to seize Ukraine quickly failed, Russia launched a new stage of this war: an informational one. The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce the support for Ukraine from the international community. International organizations criticize the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces fight against the aggressor, and thus, they become complicit in the Russian information war. For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military is setting up its positions around civil infrastructure facilities. At the same time, the same organization ignored that the positions were located only in areas where the civilian population had evacuated entirely. Do not fall for the informational attacks of the Russian Federation! Remember that Russia attacked Ukraine, occupied its territories, and keeps killing and torturing the civilian population while destroying cities and villages. The Russian Federation is responsible for the war and has no right to any actions on the territory of another country. Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and expel the enemy from the occupied territories. \n\nHelp Ukraine resist Russia on all fronts!\n\nVisual author: Oleksandra Promska\n"

    "English": "**Russia is trying to steal electricity that Ukraine could have supplied to the EU.** \n\nThis attempt can provoke a powerful nuclear explosion. In February 2022, the Ukrainian energy system disconnected from the Russian and connected to the European one in March. Consequently, by summer, Ukraine got the capacity to double its electricity exports to Europe. Currently, there's a surplus of electricity in Ukraine: this Ukrainian resource can stabilize electricity prices in eastern and central Europe. However, Russian aggression will most likely ruin these plans. Russia seized control of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, one of Ukraine's most potent electricity producers, and started plugging it into the Russian power grid. The Russian Federation needs this electricity to power facilities in Crimea and subsequently control the electricity supply in the occupied territories in south Ukraine. Even the threat of a nuclear explosion during reconnection does not stop the Russians. The International Atomic Energy Agency has already confirmed that it does not monitor the plant operations and does not know what is happening there now. Ukraine must liberate the territories occupied by the Russian army. \n\nSupport the process of providing Ukraine with powerful weapons to stop Russia!\n"

Now, these groups are working against Ukraine. Users can often find fake reports about Ukraine's Armed Forces retreat, President Zelensky's escape, threats of missile strikes with exact coordinates of objects, etc., across Ukrainian social networks.\n\nRussian intelligence uses Internet bots to spread false information in other countries. Recently, the Russians actively promoted the fake that Western weapons sent to Ukraine appeared on the black market, so it is better to stop the weapons supply. The sources of such messages are primarily anonymous. \n\nWith these information attacks, Russia is trying to split the unity of the Western world regarding support for Ukraine, sow panic and despair among Ukrainians, and divert public attention from the Russian war against Ukraine. \n\nRussia is an aggressor and a terrorist country. It destroyed the world security order and increased tensions between countries. The Russian Federation must lose the war and answer for all crimes in Ukraine and damage to the world.

Resonant events instantly divide Ukrainians into at least two camps: supporters and opponents of an idea, personality, theory, etc. Ukrainian society even has a concept of \"internet-srach,\" which means a fierce dispute in the online space. \n\nSuch discussions have become a marker of normalcy for Ukrainians. After the Russian invasion, Ukrainians were so shocked they stopped arguing about anything on social media. Later, \"srach\" has returned, especially on household and political topics – a sign that Ukraine has managed to deal with an initial shock and is adapting to the wartime realities of life. \n\nWhen the plurality of opinions in the country and the opportunity to express them freely exist, this signifies democracy. Precisely to prevent Ukraine from turning into Russia, Ukrainians are fighting so desperately against the much stronger Russian army. Support Ukraine!\n"

However, there may be cases when Ukrainians do not show the best behavior. There is an explanation for this. \n\nUkraine survived a long Soviet occupation. Communist Russian influences were much stronger here than in Poland, the Czech Republic, or the Baltic states. Totalitarianism, poverty, low-quality education, inability to travel freely, Russian language, and culture do not contribute to improving people. Over the past 30 years, Ukrainians have qualitatively changed in many areas. They made a leap in democracy and a sense of dignity compared to the Russians. But in the case of the older generation, the legacy of the USSR is still visible. Ukraine needs to win the war to get rid of destructive ties with the Russians and the Soviet legacy.

The Kremlin cannot present evidence of the Ukrainian army improperly using the weapons. \n\nDuring the last eight years of the war with Russia, the Ukrainian military actively implemented NATO practices and standards. During this time, Ukraine created a strong and combat-ready army. The large-scale Russian invasion showed that Ukraine's Armed Forces are capable of fighting effectively. Ukraine's victory over Russia is only a matter of time. The more and faster the partner countries provide Ukraine with weapons, the sooner the war will end.\n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

Inflicting this, Russia causes more hunger across the world. Due to the Russian war, the number of people suffering from food shortages can increase by more than 40 million globally. As Russians destroy Ukrainian crops, they also steal harvested grain from Ukrainian storages, destroy agricultural infrastructure, and block maritime exports. The Russian Federation's military aggression manifests itself in eliminating Ukraine's agricultural potential. This way, Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase the pressure on the world. \n\nWe need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue killing people and blackmailing the world!\n"

The dog has already found more than 250 Russian mines and shells. Patron is not professionally trained to search for explosive devices; he was a pet of the head of the Emergency Department. The man would often take the dog to work, and eventually, Patron learned to sniff out explosives and not be afraid of explosions.\n\nIn recent months, Patron has become one of Ukraine's most popular media characters. People place stickers with his image on cars, dedicate murals to him, and there are also Patron-themed children's toys and fairy tales. The canine deminer's Instagram page, patron\\_dsns, has more than 330,000 followers. In May, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, awarded Patron the medal \"For Dedicated Service.\" \n\nPatron's weight is only 4 kilograms, so Russian mines are no threat to him, but this deminer's job is far from safe. Help Patron and urge your politicians to send weapons to Ukraine's Armed Forces so that Ukraine can defend its territory and save people's lives.\n"

European countries, especially those dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may feel its shortage. But this crisis will stimulate a more economical attitude to natural resources and increase energy efficiency. Europe will win when it gives up Russian energy because then Putin will be unable to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.\n\nTemporary discomfort is worth enduring, so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.\n"

In the Kyiv region, Russian soldiers hung the severed heads of chickens on clotheslines and nailed severed dog paws to a ladder. In intercepted phone calls, Russian soldiers say they eat dogs—eyewitnesses from the occupied territories confirm this.\n\nThe Russian army is cruel and merciless to all creatures that cannot defend themselves. Only the Ukrainian army can stop their crimes. Support Ukraine’s Armed Forces and campaign for the supply of weapons to Ukraine!\n"

    "English": "**How did the name of Ukrainian bread help identify saboteurs?** At the beginning of the full-scale Russian war, Ukrainians asked suspicious persons to say \"palianytsia\". Russians cannot pronounce this word correctly because this combination of sounds is atypical for them, but Russian-speaking Ukrainians can do it. Palianytsia is a type of ancient Ukrainian bread, most often cooked for holidays and used in traditional ceremonies.\n\nDuring the war, \"palianytsia\" generated many jokes and memes. This word became a somewhat humorous but practical linguistic password, thanks to which Ukrainians defined themselves in Ukraine and worldwide.\n\nThis practice of identifying enemies by pronunciation is not new. During the Second World War, the Dutch used the name of the city Scheveningen to identify Germans who mispronounced it. The Danish watchword against German soldiers was \"rodgrod med flode\". The British tested the Nazis with the word \"squirrel.\" Russian propagandists once discussed \"palianytsia\" in one of their TV programs, claiming that this word is a piece of cake for them.\n\nBut even there, they were making mistakes. Instead of saying palianytsia, they kept saying \"polunytsia,\" which means strawberry in Ukrainian. The Russian propagandists were sure that the linguistic password was the word for a summer berry\n"

    "English": "**Russia has started a new \"gas war\".** This time, it is against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war. Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transport system by more than a third. In April, it stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May to Finland. In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supplies through this route in July.\n\nRussia used gas blackmail in Ukraine in 2015. After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European development path, the Russian Federation cut the Ukrainian gas supply off for two days.\n\nFor Russia, gas has always been not just a commodity but an element of pressure in political matters. Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties. For the Kremlin, the main priority is its desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West. Financing the economy of the Russian Federation means donating to the Third World War.\n"

During the G7 summit at the end of June, Russia bombed a building in the center of Kyiv and the largest shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk in Central Ukraine.  After each direct hit, Putin declares that Russia does not kill the civilian population, and that the photos and videos from the scene of the events are staged.\n\nThese actions of Russia are terrorism. By killing civilians in Ukraine, Putin is threatening the US and Europe with a new war. This is how Russia is trying to force the world not to support Ukraine and to refuse arms supplies.\n\nThe only effective way to fight Russian terrorism is to deprive the Russian Federation of the opportunity to commit these crimes. Russia must suffer a crushing defeat in the war with Ukraine. Only after that can real negotiations on ensuring peace on the European continent begin.\n"

For example, EU countries that accept Ukrainian refugees plan to spend 26 billion euros on supporting them this year.\n\nSuppose the war lasts longer than a year. In that case, the purchasing power of rich countries is expected to decline, and developing countries are expected to suffer from famine. The environment will also suffer because developed countries continue using coal to stay independent from Russian gas.\n\nPutin benefits from an ongoing war in Ukraine, a way to weaken Western economies and force Europe and the United States to ease sanctions. The sooner Russia suffers a military defeat in Ukraine, the sooner the economic situation in most countries will improve.\n\nThe Ukrainian military urgently needs a lot of modern weapons to secure a win over Russia faster.\n"

This is a quote from a Ukrainian serviceman from Snake Island. He said that in response to the invaders from a Russian warship who offered Ukrainians to lay down their arms and surrender in the early days of the full-scale war.\n\n2\\. Good evening, we are from Ukraine. The phrase became popular thanks to the music track of the electronic duo PROBASS ∆ HARDI. Now it's a symbolic greeting in Ukraine. For example, the head of the Mykolayiv Regional State Administration Vitaliy Kim, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov, and others opened their video addresses with it.\n\n3\\. Put seeds in your pockets! This is an excerpt from a conversation between a resident of occupied Genichesk in southern Ukraine and a Russian soldier. The local woman advised the soldier to put the seeds in his pockets so sunflowers would grow from his body when he gets killed. The video of the conversation went viral.\n\n4\\. God, what a weirdo! In 2020, a TikTok influencer Nata Dominska posted a video with her grandmother who used this phrase to comment on a boy dancing outside their house. After February 24, 2022, Ukrainians often use the same phrase to comment on Russians' obnoxious behavior and statements.\n\n5\\. Rusni pyzda. These words belong to Taras Chmut, a soldier, volunteer, and head of the Come Back Alive Foundation. This laconic swearing means that every Russian occupier will be destroyed on Ukrainian soil.\n"

Schools also militarize children in the occupied territories of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Under the guise of \"national-patriotic education,\" the students are groomed to potentially participate in the war.\n\nForcing Ukrainian children to follow the country's aggressor's programs is a cynical exploitation of minors.

However, there is no single recipe because each family cooks this meal in its own way.  Ingredients vary depending on the development of food culture in a particular region of Ukraine and the historical period, but the sweet and sour fragrant taste remains a must. Borsch is also among the ritual dishes.  It is cooked for a memorial service.  In the Ukrainian diasporas of Canada, Brazil, and the United States, it is a wedding dish, too.\n\nUkraine has applied to include the Ukrainian borsch in the UNESCO World Intangible Heritage List.  When Ukraine wins, Ukrainians will cook a lot of borsch and invite everyone, who helped fight Russia, to try it.  The main thing now is to continue supplying Ukraine with weapons and providing economic assistance.\n"

Such atrocities come as a consequence of Russia never facing punishment for its previous military campaigns. Over the past few decades, Russians have committed war crimes in Venezuela, Syria, Georgia, and African countries. Unless Russia suffers a crushing defeat, it will not stop its aggression. Only Ukraine's victory will allow it to sign a peace agreement with Russia. The peace agreement is only the first step toward creating conditions for secure coexistence with Russia. \n\nSupport Ukraine, so war criminals face justice and peace reigns sooner in Europe.\n"

Such daily expenditures are comparable, for example, to the annual GDP of the small island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Russia funds its war in Ukraine with gas and oil sales. In the meantime, 30% of Russia's territory still doesn't have a centralized gas supply. The Russian Federation plans to finish connecting citizens to the gas grid only in 2030.\nInterestingly, in 2022 Russia plans to spend only $1.5 billion on gas networks. Instead of improving the quality of life for its citizens, modern Russian funds wars. As long as Russia makes enormous profits from its energy monopoly in Europe and Asia, the threat of new wars remains high. The world must refuse Russian oil and gas as soon as possible because it keeps financing wars!\n"

    "English": "So what does Ukraine want?  Today, Ukrainians are fighting for their independence, which Russia has been trying to destroy for hundreds of years. Since the days of the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union, Russians have been doing all they can to keep Ukraine on Moscow's short leash. Russia stays convinced that the Soviet Union still exists, so Ukraine, as its former republic, must obey the will of the Kremlin. Russia has hindered the Ukrainian efforts for European integration, funding pro-Russian media in Ukraine, paying experts to broadcast Kremlin narratives, and sponsoring pro-Russian political parties. Ukraine continued its path toward the EU and NATO membership. Therefore, on February 24, Russia tried to seize power in Ukraine by force. Ukraine is not part of Russia. It has a unique language, culture, and history. So Ukraine wants to decide its future!\n"

At the same time, the popular author of electronic music from South Africa, The Kiffness, made a remix of Andriy's performance.  Recently, for the first time in 30 years, Pink Floyd co-recorded the single \"Hey Hey Rise Up\" with Andriy Khlyvnyuk, and the song immediately topped the iTunes charts worldwide.  More than 100 years ago, the Sich Riflemen, a Ukrainian volunteer legion in the Austro-Hungarian army, adopted the song as their anthem.  In World War I, the volunteers fought against the Russian Empire army.\n Ukraine is fighting Russia again.  Support Ukrainians - let's sing together!\n"

When the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called on the Eurovision stage to rescue the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol, the next day the Russians wrote on their missiles \"Kalush, as you asked! #to Azovstal\". When Russians launched missiles to fire on the Kramatorsk railway station on April 8, 2022, they wrote \"For children\" on them. That cynical attack killed 61 people, including 7 children. The tradition of making inscriptions on shells and missiles dates back to the First World War. During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies. At the time, it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land. Today, the Russian military's inscriptions left on the missiles are a cynical and cruel gesture by the aggressor army. These missiles kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine only because they do not like Ukraine's political course. Russia must be stopped so that such \"messages\" won't land in any other country!\n"

They fired on chemical and nuclear power plants, set oil depots on fire, and detonated thousands of shells. The worst situation is in Mariupol. Tens of thousands of murdered civilians have been chaotically buried or are decomposing in the open air. Sewage is not being cleaned. Garbage is not taken out. All infrastructure is destroyed. Corpse poison and human waste seep into groundwater and the Sea of Azov. There is a high chance that chemical compounds from the steel factory Azovstal could get into the sea in case of a large-scale shelling. Other countries also experience the consequences of the barbaric disturbance of ecosystems in Ukraine. The only chance to save the environment is to force Russia to stop this war!

At one time, Iran tried to implement a similar scenario, but the country has been under Western sanctions for more than 40 years and has so far failed to introduce successful import substitution.\nRussia still has funds to purchase goods and services abroad. This allows them to postpone the negative effects of sanctions on Russians. That is also why they still believe in Putin's ability to provide them with a decent life so people in Russia keep on supporting the war against Ukraine.\nWe need a full energy embargo and a ban on trade with Russia!

They are being shot at, abducted, tortured, and intimidated by the Russian military which tries to stop their resistance.\nRussia is actively using pseudo-referendum technic as well as the formation of pseudo-republics to legalize its own military aggression. This is exactly how Russia acted in 2014 during the capture of Crimea. According to this scenario, fake “republics” were also created in eastern Ukraine: the so-called “Donetsk People's Republic” and “Luhansk People's Republic”. Prior to that, Russia did the same in Georgia with South Ossetia and Abkhazia and in Moldova with Transnistria. The world is projected not to recognize these “referendums”.\nMoscow has been using these technologies for over a hundred years. In 1917, the Russian Bolshevik army captured Kharkiv and proclaimed a pseudo-republic there. The USSR was formed using such methods. \nUkraine needs more support to prevent Russia's creation of new pseudo-republics!\n"

    "English": "Russian Church is a massive propaganda mouthpiece.  It is completely under the patronage of Moscow and is part of the state apparatus.  In their sermons, Russian priests preach about  the \"holy war against Ukraine\" and bless Russian military to murder Ukrainians.  It is easy to explain this zealotry with which the Russian Church is serving the Kremlin.  In 1920-30s, Stalin liquidated the first ROC (Russian Orthodox Church), and then, during the Second World War, he restored it.  With religion, it was easier to control the population. To achieve that, Orthodox priests became employees of the Soviet security services. Russian priests spread Kremlin's propaganda all over Eastern Europe for decades.  Before February 24, 2022, the Russian Orthodox Church had a considerable influence in Ukraine.  After Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine, the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church were repeatedly detained for collaboration and for transferring information to the enemy.  Now, Ukraine experiences a wave of public rejection of the Russian Church by religious communities.  Russian Church is not about Christian values, but about exaltation of imperial ideology.  Do not trust it!\n"

    "English": "Russia denies people the right to live on their native land.  So it was in 1944, when the Kremlin falsely accused Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis.  Then, on 18-21 of May,  nearly 194,000 Crimean Tatars, the indigenous people of Crimea, were deported against their will.  Nearly half of deportees died on the road and in the first years of exile. Crimean Tatars could return to the peninsula only in 1990s, and since then, they have struggled for years to regain their rights.\n After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia again launched massive repression of the Crimean Tatars.  This time, the Kremlin wrongly accused Crimean Tatars of terrorism and conducted searches, detained, and imprisoned people for up to 20 years in a penal colony. Some Crimean Tatars may face life imprisonment.  There are cases of killings and disappearances in the peninsula, too.  This way, Russia is punishing people for disloyalty to the occupation authorities.  Crimean Tatars are again forcibly deported to Russia, where they are being judged.  After 70 years, indigenous people of Crimea are once again denied their homeland. \nNowadays, Russia extends criminal practice of deportation to other occupied territories of Ukraine.  This must stop!  Lobby your politicians to give Ukrainian army arms and strengthen sanctions against Russia!\n"

    "English": "Russia has always used language as an instrument of aggression. As early as the 18th century, the Russian Empire banned scientific activities and book printing in the Ukrainian language, and closed Ukrainian-language schools and cultural centers. During the last three centuries, the Ukrainian language has been banned 134 times. As a result, almost a third of Ukrainians today speak Russian. Russia is actively spreading the myth of oppression of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. This was one of the reasons for Russia to start the war in eastern Ukraine, capture Crimea, and later, launch a full-scale invasion. Now the State Duma of the Russian Federation is considering an absurd bill to recognize all those who “speak Russian” as “compatriots.” This should give Russia the right to “protect” Russian-speaking people around the world from far-fetched oppression. So, if there are Russian-speaking communities in your country, there is a chance that Russia may come to “liberate” them.\n\n"

    "English": "On May 9, Russia pompously celebrates Victory Day in World War II. In terms of scale, it is the largest Russian holiday of the year. While Europe commemorates this greatest tragedy of the 20th century, the Russians are holding a large-scale military parade and salutes. World War II ended 77 years ago. However, the farther we move from this date, the louder and more absurd the celebration in Moscow gets. Every year, huge posters of Stalin are carried at the parades on Red Square, and pseudo-veterans, children in soldiers’ uniforms, and infants in trolleys decorated as tanks are taking part in the celebration. All this indicates that for almost 80 years, Russia didn’t experience anything that would make people as proud as May 9. The Russians are aggressively using the cult of victory over Nazism to militarize society and incite hostility to the Western world. Today, Russians refer to Ukrainians as Nazis. If the war in Ukraine is not stopped, tomorrow they will fight the \"Nazis\" all over Europe.\n"

    "English": "Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns. Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968. Russia borders 14 countries. It attacked 10 of them. Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural basis of the Russians. The cult of aggression and raids has been successful throughout Russia's history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years of the Putin regime. These cultural features have shaped state institutions that cultivate a policy of hatred and imperialism. Most Russians approve of wars of aggression because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states. The Russians have not yet fully felt the effects of economic sanctions. Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protests inside Russia. Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!\n"

    "English": "The Russians are robbing Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery, and the first seasonal crops from Ukraine. Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine, which are under temporary occupation by Russia. This is a conscious Russian policy: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk region in Russia have decided to \"expropriate the surplus of last year's and this year's harvest\" from the South of Ukraine. The occupying power takes away the sowing material from the farmers, but at the same time requires them to successfully sow and then send new crops to Russia. Russians prohibit the farmers to pay taxes to the state budget of Ukraine. In case of disagreement, the soldiers threaten the locals with physical violence. Russia is repeating Soviet policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s. This is how Soviets started the Holodomor, a genocide of Ukrainians via mass starvation, in 1932-33. This is also how Soviets destroyed the private property on Ukrainian lands. Under the guise of a “war of liberation against the Nazis,” Russia is provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market. Do not buy Russian goods! Demand your country to renounce any cooperation with Russia!\n"

It is already threatening Poland, Romania, Finland, and the Baltic countries. In the 1940s, Winston Churchill asked the United States for military assistance. If American pacifists had persuaded Roosevelt not to supply arms to Europeans back then, there would be no free and democratic Europe today.\nFor Ukrainians, the calls not to provide arms sound like this: surrender or die. If Ukraine does not maintain its defense, are you ready to be the next to die from Russian shells?\n"

    "English": "Ukrainian cities occupied by Russian troops are experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe. According to the UN, 12 million Ukrainians already need humanitarian aid. People hunt pigeons, drink water from pipes and batteries, and bury the dead in yards and playgrounds.\nUkrainian authorities hold daily talks with the occupiers on humanitarian corridors. But the Russians regularly violate agreements: they fire on humanitarian vehicles and ban the evacuation of civilians. Russia is deliberately terrorizing the Ukrainian population and causing humanitarian catastrophes.\nHow can you help? Contact your politicians. The authorities of each country must demand from the Russian leadership to ensure the full operation of humanitarian corridors!\n"

    "English": "The Russian army is looting Ukraine. Russian soldiers steal everything from office equipment, jewelry, money, to linen, pots, and even hairpins. They send those looted \"trophies\" (which weight around 50-250 kg, or 100- 500 pounds) via Belarusian mail to Russia.\nThe Hague and Geneva Conventions classify looting as a war crime. However, for Russia, it is a military tradition approved both by society and the government. The Russians looted during two Russian-Chechen wars, the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, and the war in Syria.\nDuring the Second World War, the USSR even had a Main Trophy Department, which kept records of looting in European countries. In 1995, looting was decriminalized in Russia.\nLooting is a war crime, not a tradition. The guilty must be punished!\n"

    "English": "Right before the Catholic Easter, a traditional procession will be held in Rome, presided over by Pope Francis. This year, a Ukrainian and a Russian woman who have lived in Italy for a long time will carry the Cross at the Colosseum. According to the Vatican, this should become a symbolic \"reconciliation of two nations\", because, as the Pope said earlier, \"we are all guilty in this war.\"\nWhy is this a bad idea? Because such \"reconciliation\" blurs a clear division: this is the aggressor, and that is the one who suffers from aggression. This decision also transforms Russia's brutal war against Ukraine to the so-called \"conflict of two neighboring nations” and blurs Russia's responsibility for the crimes committed. This procession is seen as disrespect to the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian army, which today are desperately opposed to the invader. Those guilty of crimes against humanity must be punished.\nDo not support such \"actions of reconciliation\", do not give the aggressor a chance to avoid responsibility!\n"

The scale ofwar crimes in this category is difficult to measure. Victims often do not talk about what they went through. But even now, it is clear from the testimonies of Ukrainian psychologists who are helping the war victims, that there are dozens of gang rapes on the Ukrainian territories which used to be temporarily occupied by the Russian military. This form of violence is particularly traumatic for survivors of abuse.\nThe war must end so that no woman or child in another country experiences the horror which we now have in Ukraine. What’s more, every war criminal must be punished. In the age of information technology, it is possible to identify and find the culprits!\nThat is why Ukrainians continue to fight against a country that has a much larger number of soldiers and weapons.\nSupport Ukraine in this struggle for peace and justice!\n"

After the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea in 2014, Russia was excluded from the G8. Back in 1939, the USSR was expelled from the League of Nations, and Russia considers itself its successor. This happened after Soviet troops invaded Finland. The immediate reason for the exclusion of the USSR from the League of Nations was the bombing of Finnish civilian objects by Soviet aircraft. Then in Finland, as now in Ukraine, the Russians used inhumane and forbidden methods of warfare. Russia has not changed: it continues to barbarically destroy civilians in all of its wars. Russia is a country of the past, which cannot forgive other states for wanting to develop and create better living in comparison to Russia. The Russian Federation must be stopped right now!\n"

    "English": "Ukraine is a country of people who are used to creating things: they are growing, building, and producing. Ukrainians always united in communities because it’s easier to accomplish important changes together. An active civil society on the Independence Square, or Maydan, in Kyiv in 2004 and 2014 is an example of the unity that the whole world could see. Today, this unity has manifested itself in the most powerful volunteer movement in Europe. Everyone helps as much as they can: people cook, raise money, collect humanitarian aid, cover urgent needs of the army and medics, coordinate, transport, help with evacuation, write petitions, and fight against Russian propaganda. Our Post-to-stop-war project is also done by volunteers.\nWe want everyone to know the truth about this war so the world would act! Inaction now is a crime.\nWe also call on to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine and trusted volunteer organizations. All information can be found in the section of our site called How you can help Ukraine.\nJoin the volunteer movement of Ukraine! Help Ukrainians!\n"

    "English": "Russian mobile crematoriums started operating in Mariupol. Following the widespread international outcry after the Bucha genocide, Russia's top leadership has ordered the destruction of any evidence of Russian military atrocities in Mariupol. Given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade, and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could fall victim to the Russian occupiers. To cover up the enormous scale of its crimes, Russia is preventing humanitarian initiatives in Mariupol and the complete evacuation of its inhabitants. Instead, they are trying to identify all potential witnesses to Russia's atrocities through filtration camps and kill them. Mayor Vadym Boychenko states: “The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazi concentration camps! The Russians turned the whole of Mariupol into a death camp. This is no longer Chechnya or Aleppo. This is the new Auschwitz and Maidanek. The world must help punish Russia's villains. \" Whether the genocide perpetrated by the Russians in Ukraine will go unpunished will determine whether this evil will be repeated again, but this time, in Western Europe! Look at Russia with a sober eye! A country that emphasizes its cultural heritage and glorious history turns out to be just a brutal war criminal who tries to hide the traces of one’s terrible deeds. Remember that most Russians support the war against Ukraine. They support all the atrocities that are taking place in Ukrainian cities. This is not Putin's war, but a genocide of Ukrainians, and Russians glorify and are proud of it!\n"

Russia imposed a naval blockade on Ukraine. Already by the end of March, Russians blocked the exit of 94 ships from the Black Sea which transported food. The Russian war will significantly reduce this year's harvest and exports.\nNot only Ukraine but the whole world will suffer from the war.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the loss of Ukraine, one of the largest countries in Europe in terms of territory and population, became especially painful for Moscow. Since then, Russia has been constantly trying to bring Ukraine back under its influence, especially since 1999, when Putin became Russia's president. The 2004 Orange Revolution was Putin's first defeat in Ukraine. Then Viktor Yanukovych, who was actively supported by Moscow, lost the presidential election to pro-European Viktor Yushchenko. Putin's second defeat was the Revolution of Dignity. Then, Ukrainians overthrew the pro-Russian regime of President Yanukovych, one again choosing the Western direction for Ukraine's development. The full-scale war launched by the Russians on February 24, 2022, is Putin's last argument for taking control of Ukraine. But Ukrainians will fight to the end. And they will never return to the \"Russian world\".\n"

    "English": "Russia establishes filtration camps and forcibly deports Ukrainians there. The Main Department of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine confirms cases of kidnapping Ukrainian citizens, Ukrainian military, and police. Then the kidnapped are moved to the RF, to Taganrog (the Rostov region), and the Krasnodar region in particular. After this, their documents get confiscated, and the people are sent to the northeast of Russia. According to the Mariupol city council, about 15 thousand Mariupolites were illegally deported. It seems, deporting the population, Russia mirrors the deportation actions of the Nazi regime that ruled Europe in the middle of the 20th century.\n"

    "English": "Russian troops drop 50-100 bombs on Mariupol every day. They have destroyed 80-90% of the city. The occupiers defrauded and forcibly deported 33 thousand residents to Russia. People live in an information blockade, and many do not understand what is happening. Nobody knows how many people continue to be under the wreckage and how many were wounded or killed. People have no chance to get out of there. Russian occupants killed municipal and state service people and rescuers during the days of the blockade, so there's nobody to search the city ruins. They also killed many doctors. All the survivors of the bombing will either die under the wreckage or have already died. Tens of thousands of people are buried alive under the rubble of the city, destroyed by 80%. This is a GLOBAL tragedy! Mariupol should be on front pages of all world newspapers. All world platforms and all human rights activists should talk about Mariupol! Today Mariupol is a torture chamber where Russians kill women and children in the most brutal ways!\"\n"

    "English": "Since Russia invaded Ukraine, more than 1,5 million Ukrainian children have become refugees. More than 70,000 children flee the country every day, 55 every minute. Many of those children become orphans or lose their parents and relatives. Stories about small kids crossing borders alone amaze the world and confirm the heroism of the Ukrainian nation. We are grateful to all the countries that help Ukrainian refugees. We urge them to speak up and demand the closure of airspace over Ukraine! So our children and we won't have to flee our homes, devastated by the Russian bombs.\n"
