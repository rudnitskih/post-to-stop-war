    "English": "**The Russian culture has lost touch with the contemporary world a long time ago**.\n\nThe works of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Lermontov, and Pushkin still influence the perception of modern Russia by educated foreigners. Yet classic Russian literature glorifies and promotes the trends of the blossoming empires and dictatorships: endless wars, disregard for human rights, and sexism. Many Russians continue to use the narratives of their classics. Set expressions like \"If he hits you, it means he loves you,\" \"A woman's place in the kitchen,\" and \"Great Russian people\" are still popular in the Russian Federation. For ten months, Russians remain content with Putin's decision to \"wage war against the collective West.\" It is way more convenient for them to believe that Russia could not build a prosperous state because it has been hindered by an external enemy who does not understand all the \"mystery of the Russian soul\" and seeks to destroy Russia. The truth is, Russian failures are due to their unwillingness to live in the modern world. They no longer create masterpieces that the world admires and are not trendsetters in art. \n\nLeave the \"great Russian culture\" on the pages of history textbooks and perceive Russians as they are: war supporters and enemies of the Western world. \n\nVisual author: Valeria Pinchuk\n"

Here a logical question arises: why should Russia be respected? For 30 years of independence, Russians have not created decent living conditions for themselves, although they have considerable deposits of natural resources. Russians failed to convince the world that their values and way of life were worth emulating. Drunkenness, aggression, domestic violence, disregard for human rights, and intolerance: this is Russia’s legacy over the past 30 years. \n\nThe Russians came to kill Ukrainians only because they do not like Ukraine's European integration.

Russian soldiers are purposefully shelling objects of cultural heritage throughout Ukraine. In early May, the Russian army deliberately fired a missile at the museum in the Kharkiv region dedicated to the outstanding thinker and philosopher Hryhoriy Skovoroda. Russian invaders are looting museums in the temporarily occupied territories. In particular, valuable collections were taken to Russia and occupied Crimea from the museums of Mariupol and Melitopol. More than 15,000 pieces were stolen from museum exhibits in the Kherson region alone. The looting of Ukrainian museums and cultural institutions is a large-scale Russian crime. Destroyed landmarks are lost forever, and stolen unique artifacts may never return. Just imagine the looted Louvre or the bombed Colosseum. \n\nIf Russians are not stopped in Ukraine, they will destroy and loot cultural heritage worldwide. \n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

Ukraine’s fight for independence during Russia’s energy terror found a representation in the works of the DC studios. Their comic book series “Stormwatch” now has a new superhero, Ukrainian Pavlo the Core Stupka. He is 52 but looks 16; the superhero is a “living nuclear generator” and can fly. This creative decision is quite fitting, given that Ukrainians see the character as a direct representation of their contemporary superheroes. Air defense operators are making the most of the insufficiently powerful air defense system, and Ukrainian energy engineers are repairing destroyed networks around the clock. Ukraine is making every effort to expel Russians from Ukrainian land. \n\nUnfortunately, Ukrainian superheroes are paying for freedom with their lives. Do not forget to support Ukraine!

Kherson has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The Russians demanded submission from the Khersonians. Those who refused to cooperate with occupiers were often tortured, killed, and had their relatives kidnapped. After the city's liberation, experts identify bodies found in dozens of mass graves, just like in Bucha and the Kharkiv region. When the Russians were retreating from the city, they destroyed many critical infrastructure facilities. Despite so much grief, the people of Kherson are still happy that they once again live at the Ukrainian territory. People are digging up Ukrainian flags buried in the ground during the occupation and tearing down Russian propaganda posters. The arrival of Ukrainian troops for them meant the end of fear and the prohibition of a free life. Residents of Kherson stand in queues for hours at Ukrainian supermarkets and volunteer hubs, yet, they rejoice at Ukrainian goods and aid. \n\nUkrainians are strong people, but without the support of the world, they will not be able to manage the consequences of the Russian invasion.

    "English": "**The Russian war shows the fundamental difference between Ukrainians and Russians.**\n\nRussians are used to having the \"tsar-ruler\" decide everything for them. He must give them something, provide them with comfort, and tell them what to do. Russia destroys Ukraine's energy infrastructure, counting on Ukrainians to demand that Ukraine's president immediately brings back all benefits of the civilization. The Russian logic presumes sitting down at the negotiating table and ceding territories to Russia. It will give Russia time to recover and start a new war. Building a new empire is the cherished dream of Russia's dictatorial regime. Instead, Ukrainians have always decided everything at the community level. So now, the Ukrainian community agrees that it would rather give up the comfort to preserve their country's independence. Ukraine's leadership must execute this will. Ukrainians do not expect the authorities to magically restore the country's full energy supply. Business owners and communities buy generators and Starlinks at their own expense. Ukrainians share life hacks on how to survive without electricity, water, and heat. They help those in difficult circumstances and do not expect reimbursement from the state budget. They know state funds should primarily go toward Ukraine's Armed Forces. \n\nUkrainians show the world that democracy and freedom are more important than a comfortable life. Help Ukraine stand against the war with Russia!\n\nVisual author: Sviatoslav Zembitskyy\n"

About 46,000 people found jobs in the Netherlands, which is more than 80% of Ukrainians who fled to this country because of the Russian war. More than 40% of Ukrainian refugees in Great Britain also have jobs. Ukrainians are not \"a burden to the budget of Western countries,\" as Russian propaganda claims. On the contrary, they help the European economy grow. The language barrier is the main obstacle for many Ukrainians who want to work in a new country. But over time, this issue dissolves, and temporary migrants are increasingly covering the deficit in the labor market of many EU countries. \n\nThe war will end, and many Ukrainians will return home, but until then, they will support the economies of Western countries. Support Ukrainians until Russia finally loses its war. Ukrainians will thank you with all their hearts!\n"

Ukrainian social media are full of hundreds of jokes and memes about the war. Kyiv residents began jokingly preparing for a mass orgy in response to the nuclear threats. In addition to the protective reaction of the human psyche to critical stress, Ukrainians understand that every day can be their last. Therefore, they share sentimental stories from their childhood, declare their love, and show amusing photos of their children. Many people started to do what they always dreamed of, got a dog or a cat, and made sure to spend more time with friends and relatives. Daily risk and constant struggle on the verge of life and death force people to reevaluate and stop postponing life.

The purposes, besides the religious ones, for the Russian priests to use this real estate remain unknown. In Ukraine, for example, the Russian Orthodox churches stored Russian weapons and hid militants before the full-scale war. Many priests cooperated with the occupiers and assisted them. Since the beginning of the full-scale war, the Security Service of Ukraine has opened 23 criminal proceedings against the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. Charges range from classic intelligence gathering to helping Russians adjust their artillery strikes on Ukraine. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, openly supports the war against Ukraine.\n\nLet's keep in mind that the Russian church is the provider of Putin's regime. \n\nVisual author: Anastasiia Hlivinska\n"

Putin has repeatedly stated that the Ukrainian nation does not exist. Since February 24, 2022, propaganda has reached a new level: the Russian media directly call for a “resolution of the Ukrainian issue”, and TV presenters openly call for “killing Ukrainian children.” Propaganda is also a weapon that kills. Hate speech has always been an essential tool in wars. The aggressor needs it to justify one’s aggressive actions and keep public support. Since the Second World War, the actions of propagandists have been classified as international crimes. Incitement to genocide or crimes against humanity received the highest degrees of punishment. Two Nazi propagandists were tried at the Nuremberg Trials, one of whom was executed. Neither killed anyone, but they played a significant role in the mass killing of civilians. The Russian media lie and incite the killing of civilians, and they are a threat not only to Ukrainians. \n\nAny nation can become a target of propaganda. Russian propagandists must answer for spreading lies in an international court. \n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

However, Russia has long lost the trust of the global community, given that Russia’s official statements are tales reinforced by domestic propaganda. It is not difficult to check that Russia is lying. Ukraine has invited an IAEA mission to check the condition of all facilities that, according to Russia, are involved in producing a radiological bomb. Russia uses this narrative to make the world distrust Ukraine. However, it only achieves the opposite, since you can always verify Ukrainian statements, unlike Russian ones. \n\nUkraine is a civilized European state that wants to live in peace.

    "English": "**The Russian war fundamentally changed the geopolitical mood of Ukrainians.**\n\nUkraine’s largest river, Dnipro, divides the country into the Eastern and the Western parts. Before the war, most residents of the Eastern part, which was once colonized by the Russian empire, were more tolerant toward Russia. The Western part, on the other hand, had more pro-European views as its territories once belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Polish Commonwealth. Ukrainian sociology reflected similar sentiments: according to the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, in 2020 and early 2021, 41% of respondents had a good attitude toward Russia, and 42% had a bad one. After the start of the full-scale Russian war, the situation changed: according to the sociological group “Rating”, 86% of respondents support Ukraine's accession to the EU, and 83% support accession to NATO. Ukrainians do not consider themselves a formal or informal part of Russia and want to preserve their country’s independence. This shows the manipulations behind public figures talking about the possibility of “peaceful” negotiations as Russia keeps occupying Eastern and Southern regions and attempts annexing these regions. The world wants the crisis caused by the Russian war to end as soon as possible. However, surrendering parts of Ukrainian territories to Russia will stimulate the aggressor to continue the war. For Russia, “peaceful” plans are a manifestation of weakness, which will eventually encourage Russians to start new conflicts. \nRussia must lose the same way the German Third Reich lost. This is the only thing that will stop the war and the crisis. Do not believe Russia's provocative statements and support Ukraine!\n\nVisual author: Sviatoslav Zembitskyy\n"

    "English": "**Russia once again simulated democracy by holding \"referendums\" in the occupied territories of Ukraine.**\n\nThe aggressor country turned the instrument of voluntary expression of people’s will into a forced voting procedure. Russian soldiers went to people's homes together with representatives of election commissions and demanded people to vote. When the total number of votes in the \"referendum\" still turned out to be insufficient, the Russian Federation even counted the incomplete ballots as in favor of annexation. The Russians are trying to create an impression that their country protects the interests of the Ukrainian people. In fact, Russia – like many parasites – needs this imitation to survive. This is because Russia still hopes that it will be able to win the war against Ukraine and return to the community of civilized countries with time. That is why the occupiers create illegitimate documents and want both the West and Russians to believe in their authenticity. Remember that the Russian Federation violates the laws, destroys the security system of the world, threatens with nuclear strikes, and is preparing for further escalation of hostilities in Europe.\n\nDo not trust Russia, condemn its actions and demand your governments to completely isolate Russia from the world.\n"

The losses of the Russian Federation are more than 55,000 dead soldiers. The resources of the Russian army are running out, so Putin announced the urgent mobilization of 300,000 Russians. He wants to win the war in Ukraine to maintain his power. Therefore, he now calls on Russians not just to fight against the \"Ukrainian Nazis\" but to defend themselves against the collective West. The Russian dictator believes that the West wants to \"dismantle Russia.\" For the most part, Russians support Putin, although he is ready to keep destroying not only Ukrainians but also Russians, the Russian economy, and the future of his country. The Russian Federation wants to become a \"superpower\" and strengthen its influence on the countries of the former Soviet Union. The ideals of modern Russia include terror, murders, an arms race, and human rights violations. The aggressor country must be stopped now. \n\nThe change in Putin's rhetoric means a threat not only to Ukraine's future existence but also to the development of the entire Western civilization.\n\nVisual author: Iryna Zarubina\n"

    "English": "**Europe is once again paying the price for freedom and democracy, but it does so with money.**\n\nEurope introduced sanctions that should weaken Russia. Europe gives loans to Ukraine to support its economy during the war. Europe is facing a response from Russia, which is using gas as a weapon. Russia is trying to break the unity within the EU by manipulating energy prices. This comes on top of the highest inflation in the last 40 years, which comes as a result of printing money during the pandemic. Does it feel good to pay this price? No. But if Europe does not pay this price with money, this will pose a threat to the basic values and the usual way of life, to which generations of Europeans have already become accustomed. Ukrainians, too, did not want to believe in the war before the start of the full-scale invasion, and they were more worried about the fall in GDP. Now, however, they are forced to think how to survive. Before the start of the Russian war in Ukraine, the EU was too dependent on Russian energy sources. European politicians saw Russia as their firewood shed, from which you can get energy: oil and gas, and where you just need to send money. The economic model of many states became reliable on these cheap energy sources.  Billions of dollars went to Russia, fueling Putin's thirst for conquests and revenge. Unfortunately, many Europeans have forgotten the golden rule of diversification which means that you should not put all your eggs in one basket. Europeans made their market too dependent on one gas supplier: Russia. Of course, when the war began, Russia exploited this weakness because it knew about it. The EU believed that this weapon could not be used against Europe because it did not benefit Putin. Indeed, Putin is much more dependent on the European market than Europe is on Russian energy, but he still took this step. The Russian budget has already become deficit due to Putin's self-embargo, so Gazprom is reducing production and will never again become that rich company that buys football clubs and some European politicians. The EU needs time to correct the mistakes of the past because now, it needs to build infrastructure to get gas from other regions of the world. Until then, it is necessary to reduce consumption and pay more due to the shortage in the market. This is the price for freedom, which, fortunately, can be paid with money. Otherwise, we would have to pay for this freedom with the lives of Europeans. Ukraine is currently paying this price for everyone. \n\n_Serhiy Fursa, investment banker, deputy director at Dragon Capital_\n\nVisual author: Anastasiia Hlivinska\n"

    "English": "**In Ukraine, the Russians are repeating the scenarios of the Hitler regime of the 1930s and 1940s.**\n\nEven the beginning of the full-scale invasion is an allusion to the World War II: the Russians invaded Ukraine at about 4 a.m. without declaring war. Before the start of mass hostilities, the Russian Federation declared its protection of Russian-speakers in Eastern Ukraine and supported separatists in Donbas in 2014. In the same way, Hitler \"protected\" German speakers in the Sudetenland in 1938. The Russians annexed Crimea in March 2014, just as the Germans conducted the Anschluss of Austria in March 1938. Russians consider themselves a superior nation and are punishing their “little brothers” as they call Ukrainians for every manifestation of independence. This can be seen from the intensity of the bombings of Ukrainian cities, which take place on significant dates for Ukraine. For example, on June 28, on the Day of the Constitution of Ukraine, the Russians massively shelled the South and East of Ukraine, and the day before, they destroyed a shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk. On July 28, on Ukraine's Statehood Day, Russia massively shelled 7 regions of the country. Russians are a nation that wants to start a new world war according to Hitler's methods and take over Europe. \n\nUkraine needs weapons to stop the aggressor and end this war!\n\nVisual author: Nastya Gorban\n"

    "English": "**Why not only Putin but every Russian is to blame for the war against Ukraine?**\n\n1\\. \"This is Putin's war, not the Russian war.\" Putin started this war and ordered the destruction of Ukrainian cities. But these are Russian citizens, who drop bombs on residential buildings, kill civilians during evacuations, torture Ukrainian prisoners and locals, loot and destroy property. Similarly, Putin did not perpetrate the genocide of Ukrainians in Bucha and Mariupol. Russian soldiers did, although Putin is undoubtedly guilty of it, too, as the head of a terrorist state.\n\n2\\. \"The war is just Putin's sick ambitions.\" Long before Putin was born, different Russian regimes and rulers spent centuries trying to seize Ukrainian territories, destroy the culture and the language, and deny the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation. A recent CNN survey shows that 64% of Russian responders consider Ukrainians and Russians as one nation.\n\n3\\. \"I did not kill anyone.\" Everyone who lives or works in Russia sponsors the war. The money from the Russian budget buys missiles and bombs flying at Ukrainian cities. To be complicit in the war, you don't need to kill anyone as long as you buy ammunition.\n\n4\\. \"We can't change anything.\" Change is never easy. Over the last 30 years, three revolutions have taken place in Ukraine. Ukrainians went out on mass protests, disagreeing with the policies of the governments of that time. Ukrainians paid a terrible price in 2014; back then, more than a hundred protesters were killed. On the contrary, Russians keep believing the propaganda unconditionally and are afraid or unwilling to change anything.\n\n5\\. \"Why are Russian athletes, scientists, or artists at fault?\" Abroad they all represent Russia, the aggressor state that invaded the territory of independent Ukraine and is killing people there.\n\nDemand that Russians bear responsibility for the war against Ukraine. Remind them that not only Putin is to blame, but every one of them. \n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

On May 16, during the evacuation of Ukrainian defenders from \"Azovstal\" in Mariupol, the Red Cross acted as a neutral mediator when the soldiers were exiting the city, which did not spare the Ukrainian prisoners of war. In late July, Russian artillery fired at a prison in a temporarily occupied Olenivka, where they kept Ukrainian prisoners of war. Approximately 40 people were killed, and another 130 were injured. The Red Cross representatives failed to access the prisoners of war. Neither were they able to reach the wounded Ukrainian soldiers and the bodies of those killed in Olenivka. In early August, the human rights organization Amnesty International noted in its report that the Ukrainian military endangered civilians by stationing in schools and hospitals. This statement is a cynical manipulation. At the same time, Amnesty International did not pay enough attention to the crimes committed by Russians in Ukraine. Such statements are part of Russia's discrediting campaign against Ukraine. \n\nRussian aggression in Ukraine has shown that the conventional approaches of international human rights organizations are ineffective. Instead, such institutions should unite and build new rules for dealing with Russia.\n\nVisual author: Khrystyna Valko\n"

The match between Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk and British Anthony Joshua is one of the significant recent sports victories. \nOn August 20, Usyk defended the world champion title in the most prestigious weight category, showing that Ukrainians are unbreakable not only on the battlefield but also in sports. Besides, Usyk reminded the world about Russia's war against Ukraine on live TV. At the press conference before the fight, the Ukrainian boxer wore Ukrainian national clothes and sang a popular Ukrainian song, \"Hey, Hey, Rise Up!\" Immediately after the match, Usyk ended his speech with the words, \"Ukraine will win!\" \n\nUkraine will win, but it will happen faster with support from the rest of the world.

The aggressor country is amping up its pressure on the European community in all possible ways so that the West relieves the sanctions introduced due to the Russian war in Ukraine. It is crucial to understand that Europe will be able to reject Russian energy within a year. Consequently, Russia will lose one of its last leverages against Western countries. So Russia is using all its resources to force the EU to negotiate. \n\nHowever, negotiations with the aggressor are possible only after the Russian withdrawal of troops from Ukraine and admission of guilt in starting the war.

The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce the support for Ukraine from the international community. International organizations criticize the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces fight against the aggressor, and thus, they become complicit in the Russian information war. For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report that the Ukrainian military is setting up its positions around civil infrastructure facilities. At the same time, the same organization ignored that the positions were located only in areas where the civilian population had evacuated entirely. Do not fall for the informational attacks of the Russian Federation! Remember that Russia attacked Ukraine, occupied its territories, and keeps killing and torturing the civilian population while destroying cities and villages. The Russian Federation is responsible for the war and has no right to any actions on the territory of another country. Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and expel the enemy from the occupied territories. \n\nHelp Ukraine resist Russia on all fronts!\n\nVisual author: Oleksandra Promska\n"

In February 2022, the Ukrainian energy system disconnected from the Russian and connected to the European one in March. Consequently, by summer, Ukraine got the capacity to double its electricity exports to Europe. Currently, there's a surplus of electricity in Ukraine: this Ukrainian resource can stabilize electricity prices in eastern and central Europe. However, Russian aggression will most likely ruin these plans. Russia seized control of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant, one of Ukraine's most potent electricity producers, and started plugging it into the Russian power grid. The Russian Federation needs this electricity to power facilities in Crimea and subsequently control the electricity supply in the occupied territories in south Ukraine. Even the threat of a nuclear explosion during reconnection does not stop the Russians. The International Atomic Energy Agency has already confirmed that it does not monitor the plant operations and does not know what is happening there now. Ukraine must liberate the territories occupied by the Russian army. \n\nSupport the process of providing Ukraine with powerful weapons to stop Russia!\n"

In Russian culture, people only know how to laugh at someone else, never at themselves. In addition, their humor is offensive and abusive.

For example, \n\"Women of steel\" – wives and mothers of soldiers of the \"Azov\" regiment who fight every day for the return of their loved ones from Russian captivity. \n\"Mothers' March\" includes Ukrainian women who have received temporary protection abroad and organize marches to draw the world's attention to the Russian war. \n\nA strong women's movement is possible only in a country that respects democratic values, and Ukraine is precisely that country. Ukraine ratified the Istanbul Convention, designed to combat domestic violence against women despite the war. Ukraine is a part of Europe that Russia wants to destroy. Help Ukraine preserve its independence and support powerful Ukrainian women's movements and initiatives!\n"

Later, Kozaks did the same and also protest movements. Social media have now become the leading platform for exchanging opinions. Resonant events instantly divide Ukrainians into at least two camps: supporters and opponents of an idea, personality, theory, etc. Ukrainian society even has a concept of \"internet-srach,\" which means a fierce dispute in the online space. \n\nSuch discussions have become a marker of normalcy for Ukrainians. After the Russian invasion, Ukrainians were so shocked they stopped arguing about anything on social media. Later, \"srach\" has returned, especially on household and political topics – a sign that Ukraine has managed to deal with an initial shock and is adapting to the wartime realities of life. \n\nWhen the plurality of opinions in the country and the opportunity to express them freely exist, this signifies democracy. Precisely to prevent Ukraine from turning into Russia, Ukrainians are fighting so desperately against the much stronger Russian army. Support Ukraine!\n"

Before that, the Russian side pledged to international organizations to preserve the lives and health of Ukrainian defenders.  Killing and torturing prisoners of war is a war crime.\n\nRussians detain many Ukrainian and foreign military personnel.

The world should change its approach to interacting with Russia, which violates modern international law principles.

As they arrive in a new place, they often start looking for work, get together, and organize schools for their children immediately. However, there may be cases when Ukrainians do not show the best behavior. There is an explanation for this. \n\nUkraine survived a long Soviet occupation. Communist Russian influences were much stronger here than in Poland, the Czech Republic, or the Baltic states. Totalitarianism, poverty, low-quality education, inability to travel freely, Russian language, and culture do not contribute to improving people. Over the past 30 years, Ukrainians have qualitatively changed in many areas. They made a leap in democracy and a sense of dignity compared to the Russians. But in the case of the older generation, the legacy of the USSR is still visible. Ukraine needs to win the war to get rid of destructive ties with the Russians and the Soviet legacy.

The canine deminer's Instagram page, patron\\_dsns, has more than 330,000 followers. In May, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, awarded Patron the medal \"For Dedicated Service.\" \n\nPatron's weight is only 4 kilograms, so Russian mines are no threat to him, but this deminer's job is far from safe. Help Patron and urge your politicians to send weapons to Ukraine's Armed Forces so that Ukraine can defend its territory and save people's lives.\n"

But to become independent from Russian energy, the EU needs time. Meanwhile, Putin's regime threatens Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and a lack of home heating. European countries, especially those dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may feel its shortage. But this crisis will stimulate a more economical attitude to natural resources and increase energy efficiency. Europe will win when it gives up Russian energy because then Putin will be unable to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.\n\nTemporary discomfort is worth enduring, so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.\n"

Russians mine children's toys or shiny objects that can attract children – this is how they try to destroy as many Ukrainian civilians as possible. \nOn the outskirts of the towns freed from the occupiers, people are advised to stay on the main roads, stay out of the forests, and not touch suspicious things.

Palianytsia is a type of ancient Ukrainian bread, most often cooked for holidays and used in traditional ceremonies.\n\nDuring the war, \"palianytsia\" generated many jokes and memes. This word became a somewhat humorous but practical linguistic password, thanks to which Ukrainians defined themselves in Ukraine and worldwide.\n\nThis practice of identifying enemies by pronunciation is not new. During the Second World War, the Dutch used the name of the city Scheveningen to identify Germans who mispronounced it. The Danish watchword against German soldiers was \"rodgrod med flode\". The British tested the Nazis with the word \"squirrel.\" Russian propagandists once discussed \"palianytsia\" in one of their TV programs, claiming that this word is a piece of cake for them.\n\nBut even there, they were making mistakes. Instead of saying palianytsia, they kept saying \"polunytsia,\" which means strawberry in Ukrainian. The Russian propagandists were sure that the linguistic password was the word for a summer berry\n"

Among the companies that remain in Russia are Asics, Benetton, Colin's, Diesel, Fujifilm, Giorgio Armani, Gorenje, Lacoste, Leroy Merlin, Makita, Oppo, Patreon, Philips, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Teva, UniCredit and dozens of others. Remember these companies!\n\nWorking in a country recognized as a terrorist in the civilized world is a conscious business position. It is up to you to decide whether to support a war-tolerant business.\n"

    "English": "**Russia has started a new \"gas war\".** This time, it is against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war. Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transport system by more than a third. In April, it stopped supplying gas to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May to Finland. In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supplies through this route in July.\n\nRussia used gas blackmail in Ukraine in 2015. After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European development path, the Russian Federation cut the Ukrainian gas supply off for two days.\n\nFor Russia, gas has always been not just a commodity but an element of pressure in political matters. Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties. For the Kremlin, the main priority is its desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West. Financing the economy of the Russian Federation means donating to the Third World War.\n"

On April 28, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building in Kyiv during the visit of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to the capital of Ukraine.  During the G7 summit at the end of June, Russia bombed a building in the center of Kyiv and the largest shopping center in the city of Kremenchuk in Central Ukraine.  After each direct hit, Putin declares that Russia does not kill the civilian population, and that the photos and videos from the scene of the events are staged.\n\nThese actions of Russia are terrorism. By killing civilians in Ukraine, Putin is threatening the US and Europe with a new war. This is how Russia is trying to force the world not to support Ukraine and to refuse arms supplies.\n\nThe only effective way to fight Russian terrorism is to deprive the Russian Federation of the opportunity to commit these crimes. Russia must suffer a crushing defeat in the war with Ukraine. Only after that can real negotiations on ensuring peace on the European continent begin.\n"

The Russians burn some books right on the streets or take them to an unknown destination. For instance, in Mariupol, the Russians burned down the library of the Petro Mohyla Orthodox Church, which comprised several unique books.\n\nThe Russian practice of burning the literature they don't like stretches back through the ages: as early as 1627, Russians burned Ukrainian books following the order of the tsar. Similarly, members of the pro-Russian movement burned Ukrainian books in Crimea in 2010.\n\nRussia calls the fight against Ukrainian literature an essential component of its \"denazification.\" Russia is used to destroying the legacy of other cultures with impunity and replacing it with its own propaganda.

This is a quote from a Ukrainian serviceman from Snake Island. He said that in response to the invaders from a Russian warship who offered Ukrainians to lay down their arms and surrender in the early days of the full-scale war.\n\n2\\. Good evening, we are from Ukraine. The phrase became popular thanks to the music track of the electronic duo PROBASS ∆ HARDI. Now it's a symbolic greeting in Ukraine. For example, the head of the Mykolayiv Regional State Administration Vitaliy Kim, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov, and others opened their video addresses with it.\n\n3\\. Put seeds in your pockets! This is an excerpt from a conversation between a resident of occupied Genichesk in southern Ukraine and a Russian soldier. The local woman advised the soldier to put the seeds in his pockets so sunflowers would grow from his body when he gets killed. The video of the conversation went viral.\n\n4\\. God, what a weirdo! In 2020, a TikTok influencer Nata Dominska posted a video with her grandmother who used this phrase to comment on a boy dancing outside their house. After February 24, 2022, Ukrainians often use the same phrase to comment on Russians' obnoxious behavior and statements.\n\n5\\. Rusni pyzda. These words belong to Taras Chmut, a soldier, volunteer, and head of the Come Back Alive Foundation. This laconic swearing means that every Russian occupier will be destroyed on Ukrainian soil.\n"

    "English": "**The occupiers impose the school curriculum of the Russian Federation on the Ukrainian children.** More than 90% of principals and teachers of Ukrainian schools in Russia-occupied territories refuse to follow these instructions. Therefore, the Russians appoint their own school management that forces teachers to teach new subjects such as the Russian language, literature, and history.\n\nIn the only operating school in Mariupol, the occupiers begin classes with the Russian anthem. Schools also militarize children in the occupied territories of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Under the guise of \"national-patriotic education,\" the students are groomed to potentially participate in the war.\n\nForcing Ukrainian children to follow the country's aggressor's programs is a cynical exploitation of minors. Only the de-occupation of Ukrainian territories can stop this. Support Ukraine in the war with Russia!\n"

    "English": "**Ukrainians abroad are fleeing war, not poverty.** When Russia launched a full-scale war against Ukraine, more than 5 million Ukrainians had to flee abroad.  Most of them have found refuge in the EU.  People with different financial capacities and professions have been leaving their homes because of the war.  Some people lost everything in Ukraine and need financial help while others still have their source of income and can provide a decent standard of living for themselves.\n\nUkrainians who come to the EU are often called refugees and are considered to be from a poor country.  But Ukrainians are not refugees; they are temporarily displaced people: women, children, the elderly, who all need to be safe while Russia continues its military hostilities against Ukraine. Most Ukrainians plan to go home as soon as possible.  As of the beginning of June, more than 2 million Ukrainians have already returned to Ukraine.\n\n Ukrainians are grateful to the world for their hospitality and support.  But please remember: they are people, and not a faceless status.\n"

The Russian army has blocked or destroyed Ukraine's Black Sea ports, the main export channel for Ukrainian agricultural products. By the end of the summer, North Africa and the Middle East will face critical grain shortages. These regions have a high threat of hunger riots, and thousands of migrants will seek refuge in Europe. Russia has also not yet exported its wheat using food restrictions as a \"silent weapon\".\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian farmers have sown over 80% of Ukraine's agricultural areas compared to last year. Mines left by Russians often kill farmers in the fields. Russian shells are systematically destroying agricultural infrastructure, so predicting future harvests and exports is difficult.\n\nRussia wants not only to destroy Ukraine but also to destabilize the situation in Europe. It is necessary to stop the Russians now!\"\n"

But it is obvious that in modern Ukraine borsch, an important first course, has a much longer tradition.\n\nToday borsch is made with beets, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, and tomatoes (or tomato paste).  However, there is no single recipe because each family cooks this meal in its own way.  Ingredients vary depending on the development of food culture in a particular region of Ukraine and the historical period, but the sweet and sour fragrant taste remains a must. Borsch is also among the ritual dishes.  It is cooked for a memorial service.  In the Ukrainian diasporas of Canada, Brazil, and the United States, it is a wedding dish, too.\n\nUkraine has applied to include the Ukrainian borsch in the UNESCO World Intangible Heritage List.  When Ukraine wins, Ukrainians will cook a lot of borsch and invite everyone, who helped fight Russia, to try it.  The main thing now is to continue supplying Ukraine with weapons and providing economic assistance.\n"

The government plans to allocate 1.5 billion hryvnias from the Ukrainian state budget for the first stage. Ukraine will also turn to partner countries for financial assistance.

Such daily expenditures are comparable, for example, to the annual GDP of the small island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. Russia funds its war in Ukraine with gas and oil sales. In the meantime, 30% of Russia's territory still doesn't have a centralized gas supply. The Russian Federation plans to finish connecting citizens to the gas grid only in 2030.\nInterestingly, in 2022 Russia plans to spend only $1.5 billion on gas networks. Instead of improving the quality of life for its citizens, modern Russian funds wars. As long as Russia makes enormous profits from its energy monopoly in Europe and Asia, the threat of new wars remains high. The world must refuse Russian oil and gas as soon as possible because it keeps financing wars!\n"

The 500-year-old Svyatohirsk Monastery in eastern Ukraine was partially destroyed. The museum of Hryhoriy Skovoroda, a Ukrainian philosopher, in the Kharkiv region was bombed. Missiles also targeted the island of Khortytsia in Zaporizhya, southern Ukraine: a place of the glory of the Ukrainian Cossacks.\n\n Russia has waged war to wipe out the Ukrainian nation and culture. Russians try to create a new empire on the bones of people living next to Russia. Help Ukrainians stop this wild invasion! Help protect our shared cultural heritage!\n"

This figure is one of the highest among NATO countries. Women in the Ukrainian army have equal rights with men, which is fixed in the 2018 law. Many Ukrainian women are ranking officers. Recently, the first woman became the head of an artillery unit of Ukraine's Armed Forces. Her name is Lyubov Plaksyuk, and she used to work as a history teacher. Ukrainian women die heroically for the freedom of their country. In March, Sergeant Inna Derusova was posthumously awarded the Hero of Ukraine and the Order of the Golden Star, the highest military honors in the country.\n\nUkraine needs large-scale supplies of modern weapons from partner countries!

Many Ukrainian words in academic dictionaries were replaced with their Russian equivalents. In fact, the Bolsheviks kept implementing the guidelines from the Valuev Circular of 1863 and the Ems decree of 1867, which prohibited the printing of books in Ukrainian. The Russian Empire and later the Soviet Union sought to turn Ukraine into a Russian colony. Russian propagandists still exploit the myth of the Soviet Union creating Ukraine. Russia can not forgive Ukrainians who still preserved their culture and history after centuries of repression and want to build their state. Ukraine is not and never was a part of Russia of its own will. Help defend the independence of Ukraine: increase pressure on Russia!\n"

At the same time, the popular author of electronic music from South Africa, The Kiffness, made a remix of Andriy's performance.  Recently, for the first time in 30 years, Pink Floyd co-recorded the single \"Hey Hey Rise Up\" with Andriy Khlyvnyuk, and the song immediately topped the iTunes charts worldwide.  More than 100 years ago, the Sich Riflemen, a Ukrainian volunteer legion in the Austro-Hungarian army, adopted the song as their anthem.

When Russians launched missiles to fire on the Kramatorsk railway station on April 8, 2022, they wrote \"For children\" on them. That cynical attack killed 61 people, including 7 children. The tradition of making inscriptions on shells and missiles dates back to the First World War. During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies. At the time, it helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land. Today, the Russian military's inscriptions left on the missiles are a cynical and cruel gesture by the aggressor army. These missiles kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine only because they do not like Ukraine's political course. Russia must be stopped so that such \"messages\" won't land in any other country!\n"

They fired on chemical and nuclear power plants, set oil depots on fire, and detonated thousands of shells. The worst situation is in Mariupol. Tens of thousands of murdered civilians have been chaotically buried or are decomposing in the open air. Sewage is not being cleaned. Garbage is not taken out. All infrastructure is destroyed. Corpse poison and human waste seep into groundwater and the Sea of Azov. There is a high chance that chemical compounds from the steel factory Azovstal could get into the sea in case of a large-scale shelling. Other countries also experience the consequences of the barbaric disturbance of ecosystems in Ukraine. The only chance to save the environment is to force Russia to stop this war! We need more sanctions and a complete embargo on trade with Russia.\n"

This means that Russia will import and resell high-tech goods from dozens of foreign brands without their consent. These include medical, sound, and photo equipment, XBox sets, Apple watches, Bentley, Tesla, and Mercedes-Benz cars, and so on. \nRussia is not able to create its own model of the modern world economy despite its claims. At one time, Iran tried to implement a similar scenario, but the country has been under Western sanctions for more than 40 years and has so far failed to introduce successful import substitution.\nRussia still has funds to purchase goods and services abroad. This allows them to postpone the negative effects of sanctions on Russians. That is also why they still believe in Putin's ability to provide them with a decent life so people in Russia keep on supporting the war against Ukraine.\nWe need a full energy embargo and a ban on trade with Russia! This can make Russians realize faster that the Kremlin's policies are leading to their impoverishment and isolation.\n"

They are being shot at, abducted, tortured, and intimidated by the Russian military which tries to stop their resistance.\nRussia is actively using pseudo-referendum technic as well as the formation of pseudo-republics to legalize its own military aggression. This is exactly how Russia acted in 2014 during the capture of Crimea. According to this scenario, fake “republics” were also created in eastern Ukraine: the so-called “Donetsk People's Republic” and “Luhansk People's Republic”. Prior to that, Russia did the same in Georgia with South Ossetia and Abkhazia and in Moldova with Transnistria. The world is projected not to recognize these “referendums”.\nMoscow has been using these technologies for over a hundred years. In 1917, the Russian Bolshevik army captured Kharkiv and proclaimed a pseudo-republic there. The USSR was formed using such methods. \nUkraine needs more support to prevent Russia's creation of new pseudo-republics!\n"

It is easy to explain this zealotry with which the Russian Church is serving the Kremlin.  In 1920-30s, Stalin liquidated the first ROC (Russian Orthodox Church), and then, during the Second World War, he restored it.  With religion, it was easier to control the population. To achieve that, Orthodox priests became employees of the Soviet security services. Russian priests spread Kremlin's propaganda all over Eastern Europe for decades.  Before February 24, 2022, the Russian Orthodox Church had a considerable influence in Ukraine.  After Russia's full-scale invasion in Ukraine, the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church were repeatedly detained for collaboration and for transferring information to the enemy.  Now, Ukraine experiences a wave of public rejection of the Russian Church by religious communities.  Russian Church is not about Christian values, but about exaltation of imperial ideology.

Then, on 18-21 of May,  nearly 194,000 Crimean Tatars, the indigenous people of Crimea, were deported against their will.  Nearly half of deportees died on the road and in the first years of exile. Crimean Tatars could return to the peninsula only in 1990s, and since then, they have struggled for years to regain their rights.\n After the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russia again launched massive repression of the Crimean Tatars.  This time, the Kremlin wrongly accused Crimean Tatars of terrorism and conducted searches, detained, and imprisoned people for up to 20 years in a penal colony. Some Crimean Tatars may face life imprisonment.  There are cases of killings and disappearances in the peninsula, too.  This way, Russia is punishing people for disloyalty to the occupation authorities.  Crimean Tatars are again forcibly deported to Russia, where they are being judged.  After 70 years, indigenous people of Crimea are once again denied their homeland. \nNowadays, Russia extends criminal practice of deportation to other occupied territories of Ukraine.  This must stop!  Lobby your politicians to give Ukrainian army arms and strengthen sanctions against Russia!\n"

    "English": "Russia has always used language as an instrument of aggression. As early as the 18th century, the Russian Empire banned scientific activities and book printing in the Ukrainian language, and closed Ukrainian-language schools and cultural centers. During the last three centuries, the Ukrainian language has been banned 134 times. As a result, almost a third of Ukrainians today speak Russian. Russia is actively spreading the myth of oppression of the Russian-speaking population in Ukraine. This was one of the reasons for Russia to start the war in eastern Ukraine, capture Crimea, and later, launch a full-scale invasion. Now the State Duma of the Russian Federation is considering an absurd bill to recognize all those who “speak Russian” as “compatriots.” This should give Russia the right to “protect” Russian-speaking people around the world from far-fetched oppression. So, if there are Russian-speaking communities in your country, there is a chance that Russia may come to “liberate” them.\n\n"

    "English": "On May 9, Russia pompously celebrates Victory Day in World War II. In terms of scale, it is the largest Russian holiday of the year. While Europe commemorates this greatest tragedy of the 20th century, the Russians are holding a large-scale military parade and salutes. World War II ended 77 years ago. However, the farther we move from this date, the louder and more absurd the celebration in Moscow gets. Every year, huge posters of Stalin are carried at the parades on Red Square, and pseudo-veterans, children in soldiers’ uniforms, and infants in trolleys decorated as tanks are taking part in the celebration. All this indicates that for almost 80 years, Russia didn’t experience anything that would make people as proud as May 9. The Russians are aggressively using the cult of victory over Nazism to militarize society and incite hostility to the Western world. Today, Russians refer to Ukrainians as Nazis. If the war in Ukraine is not stopped, tomorrow they will fight the \"Nazis\" all over Europe.\n"

Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968. Russia borders 14 countries. It attacked 10 of them. Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural basis of the Russians. The cult of aggression and raids has been successful throughout Russia's history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years of the Putin regime. These cultural features have shaped state institutions that cultivate a policy of hatred and imperialism. Most Russians approve of wars of aggression because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states. The Russians have not yet fully felt the effects of economic sanctions. Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protests inside Russia. Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!\n"

    "English": "The Russians are robbing Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery, and the first seasonal crops from Ukraine. Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine, which are under temporary occupation by Russia. This is a conscious Russian policy: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk region in Russia have decided to \"expropriate the surplus of last year's and this year's harvest\" from the South of Ukraine. The occupying power takes away the sowing material from the farmers, but at the same time requires them to successfully sow and then send new crops to Russia. Russians prohibit the farmers to pay taxes to the state budget of Ukraine. In case of disagreement, the soldiers threaten the locals with physical violence. Russia is repeating Soviet policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s. This is how Soviets started the Holodomor, a genocide of Ukrainians via mass starvation, in 1932-33. This is also how Soviets destroyed the private property on Ukrainian lands. Under the guise of a “war of liberation against the Nazis,” Russia is provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market. Do not buy Russian goods! Demand your country to renounce any cooperation with Russia!\n"

    "English": "Some European organizations are urging their governments not to send arms to Ukraine. They claim that without weapons, there will be no war. What’s wrong with this view?\nWithout modern arms, Ukraine will not be able to stop Russia. So then, Russia with its imperial ambitions can go further. It is already threatening Poland, Romania, Finland, and the Baltic countries. In the 1940s, Winston Churchill asked the United States for military assistance. If American pacifists had persuaded Roosevelt not to supply arms to Europeans back then, there would be no free and democratic Europe today.\nFor Ukrainians, the calls not to provide arms sound like this: surrender or die. If Ukraine does not maintain its defense, are you ready to be the next to die from Russian shells?\n"

T-shirts with a text “Bucha Massacre: we can do it again” and the image of a butcher killing a pig gain positive and enthusiastic reviews from Russians. The themed merch even includes T-shirts for children. Russians are proud of the genocide of Ukrainians which they committed on the outskirts of Kyiv. With this merchandize, Russians once again remind the world that they are ready for the next acts of violence.\nIn general, the phrase “We can do it again” is used by Russians in the context of World War II: “Once we got to Berlin, and we can do it again.” Atrocities of the Red Army against Germans are still remembered. The path of Russia’s hero is built on blood. The only language Russians understand is the language of violence.\nPutin's army is threatening with atrocities not only Ukraine but the entire world. Call on the authorities to stop Russia so you won’t have to see the merch with the name of your city and a phrase “We can do it again.”\n"

This decision also transforms Russia's brutal war against Ukraine to the so-called \"conflict of two neighboring nations” and blurs Russia's responsibility for the crimes committed.

In the age of information technology, it is possible to identify and find the culprits!\nThat is why Ukrainians continue to fight against a country that has a much larger number of soldiers and weapons.\nSupport Ukraine in this struggle for peace and justice!\n"

After the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea in 2014, Russia was excluded from the G8. Back in 1939, the USSR was expelled from the League of Nations, and Russia considers itself its successor. This happened after Soviet troops invaded Finland. The immediate reason for the exclusion of the USSR from the League of Nations was the bombing of Finnish civilian objects by Soviet aircraft. Then in Finland, as now in Ukraine, the Russians used inhumane and forbidden methods of warfare. Russia has not changed: it continues to barbarically destroy civilians in all of its wars. Russia is a country of the past, which cannot forgive other states for wanting to develop and create better living in comparison to Russia. The Russian Federation must be stopped right now!\n"

An active civil society on the Independence Square, or Maydan, in Kyiv in 2004 and 2014 is an example of the unity that the whole world could see. Today, this unity has manifested itself in the most powerful volunteer movement in Europe. Everyone helps as much as they can: people cook, raise money, collect humanitarian aid, cover urgent needs of the army and medics, coordinate, transport, help with evacuation, write petitions, and fight against Russian propaganda. Our Post-to-stop-war project is also done by volunteers.\nWe want everyone to know the truth about this war so the world would act! Inaction now is a crime.\nWe also call on to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine and trusted volunteer organizations.

    "English": "Russian mobile crematoriums started operating in Mariupol. Following the widespread international outcry after the Bucha genocide, Russia's top leadership has ordered the destruction of any evidence of Russian military atrocities in Mariupol. Given the size of the city, catastrophic destruction, the duration of the blockade, and fierce resistance, tens of thousands of civilians from Mariupol could fall victim to the Russian occupiers. To cover up the enormous scale of its crimes, Russia is preventing humanitarian initiatives in Mariupol and the complete evacuation of its inhabitants. Instead, they are trying to identify all potential witnesses to Russia's atrocities through filtration camps and kill them. Mayor Vadym Boychenko states: “The world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazi concentration camps! The Russians turned the whole of Mariupol into a death camp. This is no longer Chechnya or Aleppo. This is the new Auschwitz and Maidanek. The world must help punish Russia's villains. \" Whether the genocide perpetrated by the Russians in Ukraine will go unpunished will determine whether this evil will be repeated again, but this time, in Western Europe! Look at Russia with a sober eye! A country that emphasizes its cultural heritage and glorious history turns out to be just a brutal war criminal who tries to hide the traces of one’s terrible deeds. Remember that most Russians support the war against Ukraine. They support all the atrocities that are taking place in Ukrainian cities. This is not Putin's war, but a genocide of Ukrainians, and Russians glorify and are proud of it!\n"

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the loss of Ukraine, one of the largest countries in Europe in terms of territory and population, became especially painful for Moscow. Since then, Russia has been constantly trying to bring Ukraine back under its influence, especially since 1999, when Putin became Russia's president. The 2004 Orange Revolution was Putin's first defeat in Ukraine. Then Viktor Yanukovych, who was actively supported by Moscow, lost the presidential election to pro-European Viktor Yushchenko. Putin's second defeat was the Revolution of Dignity. Then, Ukrainians overthrew the pro-Russian regime of President Yanukovych, one again choosing the Western direction for Ukraine's development. The full-scale war launched by the Russians on February 24, 2022, is Putin's last argument for taking control of Ukraine. But Ukrainians will fight to the end. And they will never return to the \"Russian world\".\n"

Every month, Europe transfers more than 14 billion Euros to Russia, paying for its energy resources. In tank currency, we are talking about 3,000 to 4,000 tanks per month. An embargo on Russian oil and gas will save the lives of Europeans. Life is not a tank: it is priceless. Demand an embargo - save lives!\n"

    "English": "Russia establishes filtration camps and forcibly deports Ukrainians there. The Main Department of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine confirms cases of kidnapping Ukrainian citizens, Ukrainian military, and police. Then the kidnapped are moved to the RF, to Taganrog (the Rostov region), and the Krasnodar region in particular. After this, their documents get confiscated, and the people are sent to the northeast of Russia. According to the Mariupol city council, about 15 thousand Mariupolites were illegally deported. It seems, deporting the population, Russia mirrors the deportation actions of the Nazi regime that ruled Europe in the middle of the 20th century.\n"

People live in an information blockade, and many do not understand what is happening. Nobody knows how many people continue to be under the wreckage and how many were wounded or killed. People have no chance to get out of there. Russian occupants killed municipal and state service people and rescuers during the days of the blockade, so there's nobody to search the city ruins. They also killed many doctors. All the survivors of the bombing will either die under the wreckage or have already died. Tens of thousands of people are buried alive under the rubble of the city, destroyed by 80%. This is a GLOBAL tragedy! Mariupol should be on front pages of all world newspapers. All world platforms and all human rights activists should talk about Mariupol! Today Mariupol is a torture chamber where Russians kill women and children in the most brutal ways!\"\n"

We are grateful to all the countries that help Ukrainian refugees. We urge them to speak up and demand the closure of airspace over Ukraine!

Russians detained, tortured, and killed Ukrainian civilians there. Prisoners often wrote prayers on the walls of these rooms. They believed that a higher power would help them save themselves. Similar inscriptions are found among the rubble in Turkey after one of the most terrible earthquakes hit the country. In Turkey, a father was photographed holding the hand of his dead child for hours while its body was pulled from the rubble. People in Ukraine feel this pain. But in Ukraine, parents are holding hands with their children killed by the Russian shelling. Humans are not yet able to prevent earthquakes. However, they can stop the war. \n\nUkraine's partners should act quickly and decisively. More heavy weapons for Ukraine, and the Russian war will end sooner! \n\nVisual author: Valeria Pinchuk\n"
