# Post to Stop War

![alt text](./public/logo.svg)

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start development
- `npm i`
- `npm run start`
- <http://localhost:3000>

## Deploy

We use [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) for static serving. Also pay for Pro version to allow use custom domain with HTTPS.

To deploy just run `npm run deploy`. Currently, we also publish to GitHub Pages. Maybe it is good idea to avoid paying for Surge Pro just for HTTPS.
